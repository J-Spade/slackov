# slackov

You will also need to install slackclient from https://github.com/slackhq/python-slackclient
AND replace the _client.py file with the included new one

The bot will need a configuration file. If one does not exist it will create one in the directory 
you run runSlackov.py from. Keys and values are separated by a comma (,) and will be read in when
the bot loads.
